We seek students of any background who are fearless about trying new things, are primarily interested in experiment, are self-starters, work well on a team and with external collaborators, and work best if given a certain degree of independence. If you are looking to define a new field and are looking to gain experience in a wide range of advanced techniques in physical chemistry, then come talk to us. Nanometer-scale magnetic resonance imaging Marohn's team has taken on the ambitious goal of developing a microscope for imaging single molecules in three dimensions. Imagine being able to determine the full three dimensional structure of an individual membrane protein, in situ in a flash-frozen cell, with all the protein's cofactors and post-translational modifications in place! To address this challenge, we conceived and demonstrated a new physical effect for detecting magnetic resonance using a spin-force gradient acting on a magnet-tipped attonewton-sensitivity cantilever [1] . This innovation led to the first demonstration of magnet-on-cantilever or \"scanned probe\" nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ). We modified and extended our force-gradient approach to detect electron spin resonance ( ESR ) from a nitroxide spin label widely used in biology [2] . In a PNAS paper reporting this advance and in a subsequent arXiv paper [3] , we laid out our vision for leveraging this breakthrough to determine the tertiary structure of an individual biomacromolecule or macromolecular complex by directly imaging the locations of electron spin labels attached to it. The NIH grant initially supporting this work scored in the upper 1.2 percentile. In a collaboration with a team at IBM Almaden, our team reported high-compliance cantilevers with integrated 200 nm wide cobalt nanorod tips that detected nuclear magnetic resonance at 500 μ proton sensitivity [4] . Our team was the first to create microwave-induced hyperpolarized nuclear magnetization in a magnetic resonance force microscope experiment [5] , via the dynamic nuclear polarization ( DNP ) effect. This experiment presents many exciting opportunities for increasing the sensitivity and resolution of nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging. Current work is focussed on imaging individual electron spin labels [3] . Charge generation and motion in semiconductors Our team's work has significantly advanced our understanding of charge injection, charge trapping, and charge motion in organic and hybrid semiconductors. This understanding was achieved by developing a one-of-a-kind electric force microscope that operates in high vacuum, over a large temperature range, with the ability to illuminate the sample with variable-wavelength light. We invented an approach for directly imaging trapped charge in a transistor, and were the first to record images of trapped charge in a range of molecular and polymeric semiconductors. Our images of trapped charge in pentacene [6] were particularly striking and overturned a decade of conventional wisdom regarding grain boundaries as the primary source of trapping in this benchmark polycrystalline semiconductor. We combined electric force microscopy and charge transport measurements to make a clean and unambiguous test of metal/organic charge injection theory [8] . From this data we inferred — for the first time in a single experiment — the temperature dependence of all the main factors governing charge injection: the electric-field induced lowering of the image-potential barrier, the interfacial charge density, and the charge mobility. We combined electric force microscopy with variable-wavelength light to mechanically measure the electronic spectra of long-lived charged species in a film at tens-of-molecule sensitivity [7] , identifying, for the first time, a specific molecule as the trap-causing impurity in an organic semiconductor. Our studies of ion motion in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs) [9] have generated a flurry of activity in this subfield of organic electronics. Current work seeks to image charge generation in organic semiconductors with nanometer spatial resolution and nanosecond time resolution [10] and to understand light-induced electrical and ionic conductivity in metal-halide perovskite semiconductors [11] . Nanometer-scale fluctuations Attonewton-sensitivity cantilevers push scanned probe microscopy into a previously unexplored regime where noncontact interactions between the cantilever tip and the sample dominate the measurement noise. Our team has carried out pioneering work to establish the fundamental limits of detecting forces and force gradients with a cantilever near a dielectric surface [12] . We discovered, in high vacuum measurements at room temperature, that noncontact friction was strongly dependent on the chemical composition and the thickness of the underlying polymer sample. In collaboration with Cornell theorist Roger Loring and his group, we experimentally tested a single unified theory describing both noncontact friction [13] [14] and cantilever frequency jitter [14] [15] [16] arising from molecular fluctuations. This work led to the remarkable conclusion that thermal atomic motions in the polymer interacting with cantilever charge place a fundamental limit on how small a force can be measured near a surface. These studies open up exciting possibilities for exploiting the exquisite capability of attonewton-sensitivity cantilevers to measure and map, at nanometer-scale spatial resolution, fluctuations arising from charge trapping and charge motion [17] in solar cells and other technologically important samples. Current work tries to understand nanoscale electric field fluctuations over metals at low temperature. References [1] Garner, S. R.; Kuehn, S.; Dawlaty, J. M.; Jenkins, N. E. & Marohn, J.

Growing up in Kenmore, NY , he attended St. John the Baptist grammar school, became fascinated with mathematics and chemistry at Kenmore West Senior High School, and spent a lot of time with friends outdoors while earning the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scout Troop 104. He attended college at the University of Rochester. In four years John earned undergraduate degrees in both chemistry ( magna cum laude with highest distinction) and physics ( magna cum laude ) while taking eight semesters of mathematics and somehow learning to play the banjo. He carried out research with George McLendon, studying electron transfer in proteins and charge dynamics in inorganic quantum dots. John pursued graduate study at the California Institute of Technology, doing Ph.D. research with Daniel Weitekamp. He used radiofrequency gradients to achieve record-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of solids and co-invented and demonstrated a new physical effect for optically detecting nuclear magnetic resonance in III -V inorganic semiconductor devices. While a graduate student John became interested in the idea of detecting magnetic resonance mechanically after attending a conference talk by John Sidles of the University of Washington in which he proposed the idea. He carried out postdoctoral work in mechanically-detected magnetic resonance with Doran Smith of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Raul Fainchtein of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and Lee Harrell of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. John joined the department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University in 1999 as an Assistant Professor. He is now a full Professor, a member of the Cornell Center for Materials Research, and a member of the graduate field of Materials Science and Engineering. John has been Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator on grants from NIH , NSF , and ARO . He has supervised the research of over 25 undergraduates and 30 former and 7 current Ph.D. students. M.S. students, and postdocs. His research program at Cornell has two general goals. The first is developing new approaches for imaging single molecules. He is absolutely fascinated by the idea of collecting atomically resolved images of individual biomacromolecules using magnetic resonance. In support of this goal he created an international \"nano- MRI \" conference and, while on sabbatic leave in AY 2012-2013, learned cryo-electron microscopy and molecular biology at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA . The second goal of his team's research is understanding circuits and solar cells made from plastics and organic/inorganic hybrid materials. Here his team uses custom-built scanned probe microscopes to record nanometer resolution maps of electrostatic potential, capacitance, conductivity, and electric field fluctuations in working semiconductor devices. John has created a public research notebook here that he posts to sporadically. When away from lab, John enjoys cooking, playing music with friends, and spending time with his family.","tags":"Research","url":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/pages/3-PI.html","loc":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/pages/3-PI.html"},{"title":"Group Members","text":"The Marohn group in a Zoom meeting (January 2021) .

The lesson of the first talk was two fold: (1) scanned probe microscopy measurements teach us something new about lead-halide perovskites (light leads to an increase in ionic conductivity, which lasts 10s to 100s of seconds after the light is removed) and (2) lead-halide perovskites teach us something new about scanned probe microscopy (describing the light-induced friction and frequency shifts observed over semiconductor films requires rethinking from first principles the interaction of a charge cantilever with a semiconductor film). This conference, sponsored by the Telluride Science Research Center , was a small, intense meeting of experts. The conference was organized by Sergei Tretiak and Amanda Neukirch of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Jacky Even of the Institut National des sciences Appliquées ( INSA ) de Rennes. The conference was held at an elementary school in the small town of Telluride, Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains.

L. & Marohn, J. A. \"Reverse Monte Carlo Reconstruction of Electron Spin-label Coordinates from Scanned-probe Magnetic Resonance Microscope Signals\", submitted 20 February 2018 [ arXiv:1802.07247 ]. The abstract of the paper reads Individual electron spins have been observed using magnetic resonance in combination with a number of distinct detection approaches. The coordinates of an individual electron spin can then in principle be determined by introducing a 10 to 100 nm diameter magnetic needle, scanning the needle, and collecting signal as a function of the needle's position. Although individual electrons have recently been localized with nanometer precision in this way using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as the spin detector, the experiment's low signal-to-noise ratio limited acquisition to two-dimensional scanning of just a few dozen data points and was incompatible with nitroxide spin labels widely used to label proteins and nucleic acids. We introduce and numerically simulate a protocol for detecting and imaging individual nitroxide electron spins mechanically with high spatial resolution. In our protocol a scanned magnet-tipped cantilever is brought near the sample, modulated microwaves are applied to resonantly excite electron spins, and changes in spin magnetization are detected as a shift in the mechanical frequency of the cantilever. By carefully applying resonant microwaves in short bursts in synchrony with the cantilever's oscillation, we propose to retain high spatial resolution even at large cantilever amplitude where sensitivity is highest. Numerical simulations reveal nanometer-diameter rings of frequency-shift signal as the tip is scanned. Our primary finding is that it is possible — using a Bayesian, reverse Monte Carlo algorithm introduced here — to obtain the full three-dimensional distribution of electron coordinates from the signal rings revealed in a two-dimensional frequency-shift map. This reduction in dimensionality brings within reach, on a practical timescale, the angstrom-resolution three-dimensional imaging of spin-labeled macromolecules. Our main findings are summarized pretty well in Figure 5 of the paper, reproduced below. (a) Simulated 2D scanned force-gradient signal for the doubly spin-labeled T4 lysozyme mutant pdb 3K2R .

Because the number of nuclear spins observed in their experiment was so small, the signal from spin magnetization fluctuations was much larger that the signal from the average Curie-law magnetization. It is remarkable that the IBM team was able to detect spin fluctuations and then harness them perform nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging, \"nano- MRI \". One way to improve the sensitivity and resolution of the nano- MRI experiment is to eschew detecting spin fluctuations and instead observe the average spin magnetization. This strategy requires significantly improving the spin polarization [2] . In a previous paper, Corinne Isaac and coworkers in the Marohn group showed how to increase the average spin polarization of protons in a magnetic resonance force microscope experiment using the dynamic nuclear polarization ( DNP ) effect [3] . One challenge that Corinne had to address in this experiment was aligning, in vacuum at cryogenic temperatures, a fragile magnet-tipped cantilever to a coplanar waveguide whose centerline was only < 10 μ m wide. Corinne has now published a paper in the Review of Scientific Instruments documenting numerous alignment techniques that she and her collaborators developed for use in nano- MRI and related experiments. Isaac, C. E.; Curley, E. A.; Nasr, P. T.; Nguyen, H. L. & Marohn, J. A. \"Cryogenic Positioning and Alignment With Micrometer Precision in a Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope\", Rev. Sci. Instrum. , 2018 , 89(1) , 013707 [ 10.1063/1.5008505 ][ arXiv:1710.01442 ]. The paper's abstract reads Aligning a microcantilever to an area of interest on a sample is a critical step in many scanning probe microscopy experiments, particularly those carried out on devices and rare, precious samples. We report a series of protocols that rapidly and reproducibly align a high-compliance microcantilever to a < 10 μ m sample feature under high vacuum and at cryogenic temperatures. The first set of protocols, applicable to a cantilever oscillating parallel to the sample surface, involve monitoring the cantilever resonance frequency while laterally scanning the tip to map the sample substrate through electrostatic interactions of the substrate with the cantilever. We demonstrate that when operating a cantilever a few micrometers from the sample surface, large shifts in the cantilever resonance frequency are present near the edges of a voltage-biased sample electrode. Surprisingly, these \"edge-finder\" frequency shifts are retained when the electrode is coated with a polymer film and a ~10 nm thick metallic ground plane. The second series of methods, applicable to any scanning probe microscopy experiment, integrate a single-optical fiber to image line scans of the sample surface. The microscope modifications required for these methods are straightforward to implement, provide reliable micrometer-scale positioning, and decrease the experimental setup time from days to hours in a vacuum, cryogenic magnetic resonance force microscope. Corinne's DNP experiment employed a high-compliance cantilever with a relatively large, micron-scale magnetic tip. Future experiments will employ a 100 nm diameter magnetic nanorod tip [4] . The sensitivity of these experiments will be limited by non-contact friction arising from electric field fluctuations in the sample interacting with trapped charges or patch charges on the cantilever [5] . Sensitivity can be improved by applying a thin metal coating to the sample, to act as a Faraday cage shielding the cantilever from the sample's electric field fluctuations. In her RSI paper, Corinne shows how to align a magnet-tipped cantilever with a coplanar waveguide buried beneath a metal-coated sample. This is an exciting achievement that we will certainly use in future nano- MRFM experiments. Congratulations Corinne! [1] Degen, C. L.; Poggio, M.; Mamin, H. J.; Rettner, C.

Ali spoke about his recent paper in the following talk: Tirmzi, A. M; Dwyer, R. P.; Hanrath, T. & Marohn, J. A. \"An Improved Treatment of the Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy Experiment to Track Coupled Slow and Fast Dynamics in Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite\", Materials Research Society Fall Meeting; Boston, Massachusetts; November 26 – December 1, 2017 [ 2017-11-28 talk TC01 .04.05 ]. To interpret Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy ( SKPM ) and Electric Force Microscopy ( EFM ) measurements, it is standard to assume that the tip-sample charge adjusts instantaneously, i.e. on a timescale fast compared to cantilever period, to changes in the applied tip voltage and the cantilever position. While this assumption holds for most organic and inorganic samples, the breakdown of this assumption can have a profound effect on the interpretation of experimental observations. Here we show the breakdown of this assumption on a technologically relevant photovoltaic sample, cesium lead bromide perovskite. In our experiment we applied light to the sample. As we increased the light intensity, the apparent capacitance increased nonlinearly while the sample induced dissipation increased nonlinearly, reached a maximum, and then decreased. To understand these extremely puzzling observations, we developed a more rigorous treatment of the SKPM experiment in which Lagrangian mechanics was used to model the coupled motion of the cantilever tip and charges in the cantilever and the sample. In this treatment, the measured frequency shift and sample-induced dissipation depend explicitly on the complex sample impedance [1]. This treatment revealed that the apparently puzzling photocapacitance increase and dissipation had a common origin — a monotonic decrease in the sample RC time with light intensity, from sub-millisecond in the dark to sub-microsecond at high intensity. We independently validated this sample- RC finding by performing a variant of Broadband Local Dielectric Spectroscopy ( BDLS ) as a function of illumination intensity. The resulting data confirmed that we were indeed causing a transition from the fast-response limit to slow-response limit by increasing the background light intensity applied to the sample [2]. Surprisingly, we found that sample's RC time constant relaxed on the seconds time scale (at room temperature) when the light was turned off. We measured this relaxation time versus temperature and obtained an activation energy for the relaxation process. To explain the anomalously slow relaxation, we propose a picture in which ion-associated trapping centers cause this slow relaxation. This slow relaxation of sample conductivity in the dark provides direct evidence for coupled slow and fast dynamics in cesium lead bromide perovskite. [1] Dwyer, R. P , Tirmzi, A. M. , Harrell, L.

A. \"Achieving Sub-cycle Measurements of Capacitance and Photocapacitance in a Scanning Probe Microscope Experiment by Using a Microcantilever as a Gated Mechanical Integrator\", Materials Research Society Fall Meeting; Boston, Massachusetts; November 26 – December 1, 2017 [ 2017-11-28 talk TC01 .04.03 ]. Electric force microscopy ( EFM ) and Kelvin probe force microscopy have revealed an enormous amount of useful information about organic semiconductor materials by enabling measurements of charge generation, injection, transport, and trapping with high spatial resolution. To test theories of charge generation and recombination, however, one also needs to follow sample properties with high temporal resolution. Light-induced charge generation and recombination is typically studied using nanosecond-resolution time-resolved microwave conductivity, but the technique has no spatial resolution [1]. Ginger and coworkers introduced time-resolved EFM (tr- EFM ), in which transient photocapacitance is followed by observing the cantilever's oscillation frequency with microsecond temporal resolution, and showed that the photocapacitance charging rate measured by tr- EFM was proportional to the external quantum efficiency in benchmark organic photovoltaic systems [2]. For charging rates faster than half a cantilever oscillation period (e.g., 1.5 microseconds), however, the demodulated cantilever frequency cannot be clearly interpreted because the cantilever's oscillation spectrum violates the requirements of Bedrosian's product theorem for analytic signals [3]. We introduce a new method for measuring photocapacitance transients with a scanning-probe microscope that sidesteps this seemingly fundamental limit. In our experiment [4], a voltage pulse is applied to charge the cantilever while a light pulse is applied to generate free charges in the sample. These sample charges shift the cantilever's frequency and phase of oscillation. Snapshots of the sample's evolving photocapacitance are obtained by recording the net change in cantilever phase as a function of the time delay between the light and voltage pulses. The cantilever in this experiment is essentially acting as a gated mechanical integrator. We demonstrate the method by using it to reveal a biexponential photocapacitance buildup in a polymer-blend solar-cell film, PFB : F8BT on ITO , with the fast component having a risetime of 40 microseconds at high light intensity. We demonstrate the superior signal-to-noise and time resolution of the new method by using it to record the 10's of nanoseconds probe-wiring time constant of our apparatus in ca. 100 ms of total acquisition time.

Lett. , 2017 , 111(17) , 173106 [ 10.1063/1.4999172 ][ arXiv:1710.06927 ]. The abstract of the paper reads as follows: High-quality spatially resolved measurements of electric fields are critical to understanding charge injection, charge transport, and charge trapping in semiconducting materials. Here, we report a variation of frequency-modulated Kelvin probe force microscopy that enables spatially resolved measurements of the electric field. We measure electric field components along multiple directions simultaneously by employing position modulation and lock-in detection in addition to numeric differentiation of the surface potential. We demonstrate the technique by recording linescans of the in-plane electric field vector in the vicinity of a patch of trapped charge in a 2,7-diphenyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (DPh- BTBT ) organic field-effect transistor. This technique is simple to implement and should be especially useful for studying electric fields in spatially inhomogeneous samples like organic transistors and photovoltaic blends. Below I reproduce Figure 3 from the paper, which illustrates something taught in freshman physics that is non-obvious and seldom observed directly. Organic field effect transistor: (a) topography, (b) electrostatic potential, and (c) electrostatic potential contours and the vector electric field along a line. The image in (a) is an atomic force microscope image of an organic transistor. The electrodes are the tall, dark blue features on the left and right. The working material, a small-molecule organic semiconductor, is sits in the middle of (a). The image in (b) shows the electrostatic potential φ versus ( x , y ) over the transistor after it has been operated for some time and then turned off. The white square indicates a region of relatively high electrostatic potential. This high potential is due to trapped charge. Now the cool part. The image in (c) shows lines of constant electrostatic potential near the trapped charge. In (c) we show the in-plane vector electric field E = ( E x , E y ) collected along a line (using methods introduced in the paper). We learn in freshman physics that, because the electric field is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential, the electric field E at a location r must be perpendicular to a line tangent to the constant φ ( x , y ) surface passing through r . This perpendicular relationship is clearly evident in the experimental data shown in figure (c).","tags":"research","url":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/MarohnGroup-20171026-175619--Ryan-publishes-a-paper.html","loc":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/MarohnGroup-20171026-175619--Ryan-publishes-a-paper.html"},{"title":"Ryan and Ali give talks at national and international conferences","text":"Dwyer, R.

Adv. , 2017 , 3 , e1602951 [ doi:10.1126/sciadv.1602951 ]. In the paper we introduce and apply a new scanning probe microscope method for studying charge generation and recombination in solar cell films. The method builds upon the widely used \"electric force microscope\" ( EFM ) experiment in which an electrically charged microcantilever interacts with charges in a thin-film sample. The time evolution of sample charges is followed by observing changes in the mechanical oscillation frequency of the cantilever. The problem with this EFM experiment is that it cannot observe changes in sample charge on a timescale faster than a cantilever oscillation period, a few microseconds. In the paper we introduce a new method, phase-kick electric force microscopy (pk- EFM ), in which we measure cantilever phase as a function of the time delay between a light pulse, exciting charges in the sample, and a voltage pulse, controlling the charge on the cantilever. By studying the cantilever phase as function of pulse time we learn about charge generation and recombination dynamics in the sample. We show that the time resolution of pk- EFM is not limited by the cantilever period, as in EFM , but is limited instead by the rise time of the optical and voltage pulses. In the paper we demonstrate 35 ns time resolution. We believe this resolution could be extended to picoseconds or even shorter. The pk- EFM breakthrough was described in press releases at the Cornell Chronicle [ link ] and at phys.org [ link ]. We applied for patent protection for the pk- EFM invention with Cornell's Center for Technology Licensing.","tags":"research","url":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/MarohnGroup-20170609-180000--Solar-cell-paper-published-with-press-release.html","loc":"http://johnmarohn.github.io/MarohnGroup-20170609-180000--Solar-cell-paper-published-with-press-release.html"},{"title":"Ali's perovskite paper has been accepted","text":"Ali's paper is out!

Rembrandt's advisor, Professor Tjerk Oosterkamp, traveled to the U.S. this summer, and stopped by Cornell to visit Rembrandt and the Marohn group. L to R: Tjerk Oosterkamp, Rembrandt Donkersloot, and John Marohn in front of the Physical Sciences Building at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY ) . Professor Oosterkamp's group detects magnetic resonance in thin-film samples at millikelvin temperatures [1] [2] mechanically [3] , using a high compliance cantilever to which a few-micron-diameter magnetic tip has been affixed. Detecting a magnetic resonance signal in this experiment requires applying an oscillating magnetic field to flip the electron or nuclear spins in the sample. Because electron and nuclear spins carry a small magnetic moment, these spin flips create a detectable change in the amplitude or mechanical oscillation frequency of the nearby magnet-tipped cantilever. However, applying an oscillating field causes considerable heating for experiments performed at millikelvin temperatures in a dilution refrigerator. This heating problem has become a big challenge for their temperature-sensitive experiments and they have to work hard to minimize heat generation. The Oosterkamp team creates the required oscillating magnetic field by running current through a microfabricated superconducting wire. There is a limit to the size of the oscillating field that can be created in this way however, because the current needs to remain below the superconducting wire's critical current. They also rely on force-gradient approaches to mechanically detect magnetic resonance [4] [5] invented at Cornell University in the Marohn group. These experiments observe a change in the spin state of the sample as a shift in the mechanical resonance frequency of the magnet-tipped cantilever. The advantage of this approach is that the oscillating field only needs to be applied briefly, just long enough saturate the sample spins and drive the sample's spin magnetization to zero. The sample's longitudinal spin magnetization can then be watched in real time as it returns to equilibrium by continuously observing the cantilever's resonance frequency [6] . Mr. Donkersloot worked with Hoang Nguyen, Pamela Nasr, and Corinne Isaac in our group this summer to explore using our group's 100-nanometer-diameter magnetic nanorods [7] [8] in the Leiden magnetic resonance experiments.

The goal of this outreach was to help fifth graders understand the physical properties of liquid nitrogen (liquid phase, cold -321 ∘ F), and phase changes. Our activities included We deflated air balloons with liquid nitrogen, and stuffed many of them into a small container. Then, we took the balloons out one by one and let them deflate at room temperature and asked the students to explain what they saw. We then re-froze one of the balloons to show that the gases inside the balloon actually liquified. We froze a few pennies in liquid nitrogen — some old and some new. We asked the students what they expected to see when the coins were frozen. We took the pennies out and smashed them with a hammer to demonstrate that metal became brittle when cold. The new pennies shattered easily while the older one only bent a little. We asked the students to deduce something about the pennies from what they saw. We explained that the different behaviors resulted from differences in the material composition of the pennies — the newer coins (after 1982) were made of zinc and coated with a thin layer of copper while the older coins were made entirely of copper. In another activity, we froze a banana in liquid nitrogen and tried to use it to smash a pile of frozen coins. The banana was shattered while the coins remained intact. We explained that the frozen banana was more fragile because of its high water and sugar content. In our last activity, we let the students freeze a few marshmallows in liquid nitrogen. We then let them eat this frozen treat! It did not hurt; rather, they found it tasty and cold like ice-cream. Some students were able to breathe out foggy smoke through their nose. Very cool. These activities were repeated for two classes of fifth graders and they all enjoyed it. Some students demonstrated quite a bit of prior knowledge (‘I saw it in a Youtube video before') and a great affinity for science through their clear explanations and keen observations. In an unofficial vote, our activities were found to be the coolest the students had experienced yet in their fifth grade science class.
